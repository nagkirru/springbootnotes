springboot notes






   <!-- BOM -- bill of materials
   spring core 4.2.3 - logback 1.1.3 
   
   by using spring boot all version matching setup already
   we dont need to spend time finding which library matches well ors o
   
   starter-arent will bring in all maven dependency
   
   it will pull plugin , java min version and so on
   
   take a look of BOM closely
   

there is no versio specified, because starter-parent defines depenedecy and versions
